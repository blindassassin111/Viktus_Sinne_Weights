# Viktus_Sinne_Weights
Weight files for the viktus sinne to be used solely for making replacements for the rejected top/bottom cases. Not to be used to make production runs of anything.

The main weight needs all 5 holes tapped M3x0.5 at the full depth of 3.75mm (meaning a bottoming tap) in order for the screws to thread properly.

You can remove the small alignment nubs on the top back of the main weight if need be, they are for alignment but if your part is a bit off, those will prevent assembly. So in those cases, just remove the alignment nubs.
